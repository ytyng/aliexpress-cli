# The workflow watches Cargo.toml on main and releases any version it has not

# Editing Cargo.toml by hand and pushing does the same thing; this exists to keep
# the places that carry a version in step.
#
# Nothing needs undoing if the build then fails: the version is not released, so
# fixing the cause and pushing that fix releases it. No version is left stranded
# and none has to be bumped past.
